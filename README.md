# Dataset used
The dataset is taken from Kaggle over [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models). The dataset contains 29,843 images of size 64 by 64 pixels. Please note that the dataset is very noisy; thus, you could potentially achieve better results by cleaning the dataset first.
