# CAT-DCGAN
Welcome to Cat-DCGAN, a project dedicated to the creation of captivating and realistic fake cat images using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs). If you're a cat lover, this repository is the perfect place to explore and generate adorable synthetic cat images. Here are a few images generated by demo.ipynb using the pre-trained model ⬇️

# Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle over [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models). The dataset contains 29,843 images of size 64 by 64 pixels. Please note that the dataset is very noisy; thus, you could potentially achieve better results by cleaning the dataset first.

# Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) 
### Architecture:
- Convolutional Layers: Captures spatial hierarchies and patterns in input images.
- Batch Normalization: Stabilizes and accelerates training by normalizing layer inputs.
- Leaky ReLU Activation: Introduces non-linearity to prevent neuron saturation.
- Transpose Convolution: Utilized in the generator to upsample noise and create detailed features.

### Training:
During each iteration, we sample 200 real cat images and generate 200 corresponding fake images. Subsequently, we apply Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to optimize the objective function. The training process involves initially training the discriminator followed by the generator. Notably, we maintain fixed noise throughout each iteration, avoiding the need for resampling after completing discriminator training. While there is limited research on this approach, our observations suggest that employing fixed noise enhances the stability of the training process.
